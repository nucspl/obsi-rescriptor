# Rescriptor
v0.4b for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) 1.3.7+

Rescriptor (Latin for "rewriter") is a reimplementation of [Typewriter](https://github.com/crashmoney/obsidian-typewriter) for post-1.0 Obsidian. The goal is to get the theme's aesthetics to be on-par with more recent ones, while packaging my own fixes and improvements to a handful of vanilla Obsidian's shortcomings.

### Features:
- **Soothing workspace colors, derived from Typewriter:**
	- A creamy bright color scheme, reminiscent of file folders;
	- And a muted and grayish dim color scheme, similar to a journal (currently borrowed from [Jotter](https://github.com/lnbgc/obsidian-jotter));
- **An immersive typing environment:**
	- View headers and workspace ribbons fade into the background, until hovered upon;
		- View headers support [Lost Paul's folder notes](https://github.com/LostPaul/obsidian-folder-notes), indicating which directories have a corresponding note;
	- Consistent styling, free of visual oddities that may detract attention and focus from the work at hand;
	- Plugins like [Auto Hide](https://github.com/skelato1/obsidian-auto-hide) are recommended to further streamline the writing experience; 
- **Seamless typography:**
	- [iA Writer typeface](https://ia.net/topics/a-typographic-christmas), base64-encoded for use on any platform;
	- Redone header levels, with neat inline title integration;
		- h6 headers may be placed margin-side, useful for navigating via the Outline core plugin (inspired by [Dayspring](https://github.com/erykwalder/dayspring-theme));
	- Improved callout sizing and content coloration;
		- Sleek icon positioning (from [Listive](https://github.com/efemkay/obsidian-listive-theme));
		- Works best alongside by Metadata Callouts snippet, or something similar;
- **Logical and ergonomic interface design:**
	- Hierarchical strokes, weights, and colors for interactive elements;
	- Altered positioning of file explorer elements;
	- Smaller and buttonless pinned tabs to mitigate accidental closures;
	- Larger clickspace for workspace tabs and pane buttons (inspired by [Buena Vista](https://github.com/oqipoDev/Buena-Vista-Theme));
